<h3> PL-SQL playground </h3>
PL-SQL running code: tested in Oracle 11g with Oracle SQL Developer. I have created this repo on the basis of my PL/SQL tutorial.
Which is avaiable from : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9jYtzOk-bCxVpYB_LcEC9_dNPOpDZbsS and it consists of "how we can implement PL-SQL in real time enterprise project?". If you follow this tutorial throughly then you can gain indepth knowledge of PL/SQl and oracle database.
